# Dot files

Configuration files for personal use (and therefore poorly documented), but you never know, you might find something useful.

Highlights (?)

## Vim stuff

- nvim/init.vim basic vim configuration
- `nvim/my-plugs/` my personal tweaks. Some are simple (vim-phil/plugin/correction-fluid.vim to fix typos with `,,`) others are quite involved like vim-py-kid for a python IDE or vim-mkd for pandoc processing of markdown files.

## Email

- `mutt` for email using neomutt
- `offlineimap` helps to sync the inbox

## Python

- `python` has bits and bobs and some small productivity scripts
- `erg` turns watts into splits and vice versa (important, right?)
- `abbr` adds new abbreviations to my `espanso` configuration
- `bib.py` helps to integrate citations into markdown
- plenty of othersâ€¦

## Terminal environment

- `zsh` terminal configuration
- `ranger` a much better way to integrate a file manager into your terminal
- `espanso` for snippets that save a tonne of typing
- `via` keyboard layout for Corne split keyboard

This is just a resource to which one can point for specific tasks. Better documentation may follow.
